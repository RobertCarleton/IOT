Humidity Sensor
***
Our project is a sensor that will let you know if there is too much moisture in the air. It does this by using a moisture sensor attached to Arduino Yun with an lcd screen to show you the moisture level. 
The sensor is wrapped in tissue to allow it to absorb the moisture. Then if the moisture is too high the lcd screen will change colour from green to red and display a message to warn you.
